                One day: I would like to run the two oceans ultra marathon. It is called the most beautiful race in
                South Africa. It was established in 1970 and is growing every year. Now, It is attracting more than
                12000 runners.

                Because as this post is going to explain, French is actually one of the easiest European languages to learn.
                In many ways, it's even easier than learning English! And as French is a world language, spoken by over 220
                million people, learning French can give you access to a huge chunk of the world.

                    The Mandela House was closed for repairs and restoration. Now, No. 8115 has been entrenched as one of
                    South Africa's most significant heritage sites because it tells the tale, in sound, film, interpretive
                    panels and guided tours, of the Mandela family during the apartheid era and beyond.
